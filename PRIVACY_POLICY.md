### 3. How we use information
We use information to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve the Service and core gameplay features.
- Facilitate real-time multiplayer sessions via sockets and APIs.
- Authenticate users and secure accounts.
- Send service-related communications and push notifications.
- Monitor performance, debug issues, and prevent fraud or abuse.

If we use your information for materially different purposes, we will disclose the changes or obtain consent as required by law.

### 4. Real-time communications
The Service uses real-time connectivity (e.g., Socket.IO) to enable multiplayer features. Certain gameplay data (e.g., room code, answers, match results) is transmitted to your partner(s) in the same room/session. Do not share content you do not wish to disclose to other players in your session.

### 5. AI/automation features
Some features may use automated processing to analyze or transform inputs (e.g., answer matching). Where third-party AI services are used, your inputs may be sent to those providers solely to deliver the requested functionality, subject to their terms and privacy policies. We do not sell your inputs to third parties.

### 6. Legal bases (EEA/UK users)
Where GDPR or UK GDPR applies, our processing bases include:
- Performance of a contract (providing the Service);
- Legitimate interests (security, analytics, improvement);
- Consent (where required, e.g., push notifications, marketing);
- Legal obligations.

### 7. Sharing of information
We may share information with:
- **Service providers**: Cloud hosting, authentication, analytics, notifications, and customer support vendors who process data on our behalf under appropriate safeguards.
- **Partners in your session**: Gameplay data shared with other players in the same room.
- **Legal and safety**: To comply with law, enforce terms, or protect rights, safety, and security.
- **Business transfers**: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to continued protections.

We do not sell personal information.

### 8. Data retention
We retain information only for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, including maintaining your account, providing the Service, resolving disputes, and complying with legal obligations. Session data that is no longer needed for gameplay may be deleted or de-identified after a reasonable period.

### 9. Your choices and rights
Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing of your personal information, and to data portability.

Requests can be made by contacting us at [your-privacy-email@example.com]. We may need to verify your identity. You can also:
- Manage push notification preferences in your device settings.
- Delete your account/data by contacting support (or via in-app controls if available).

### 10. Children’s privacy
The Service is not directed to children under the age where parental consent is required by local law. We do not knowingly collect personal information from such children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us to delete it.

### 11. Security
We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 12. International data transfers
Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) for international transfers.

### 13. Third-party services
The Service may link to or integrate third-party services (e.g., Google Sign-In, analytics, notifications). Your use of such services is governed by their terms and privacy policies. We encourage you to review them.

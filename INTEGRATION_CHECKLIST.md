# Integration Checklist

## ✅ Completed Integration

### Backend
- [x] Express server with Socket.IO configured
- [x] AI matcher using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for answer analysis
- [x] Vibe analysis generation with AI
- [x] Room management (create, join, disconnect)
- [x] Game state management
- [x] Real-time event handling
- [x] AI SDK dependency in package.json

### Frontend
- [x] Socket service with proper event handlers
- [x] HomeScreen with create/join options
- [x] JoinScreen with room creation and joining
- [x] WaitingScreen with player status and countdown
- [x] GameScreen with answer submission and AI results
- [x] ResultsScreen with AI-generated vibe analysis
- [x] Navigation flow between all screens
- [x] Player ID tracking throughout the game

### Data
- [x] 80+ questions across multiple categories
- [x] Vibe descriptions for different score ranges
- [x] Random question selection

### AI Features
- [x] Semantic answer matching (not just exact matches)
- [x] Similarity scoring (0-100%)
- [x] Personalized explanations for each match
- [x] Creative vibe labels and analysis
- [x] Fallback logic for AI errors

## How to Test

1. **Start Backend Server**
   \`\`\`bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

2. **Start Frontend App**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   npm start
   \`\`\`

3. **Test Flow**
   - Player 1: Create room → Get room code
   - Player 2: Join room with code
   - Player 1: Start game
   - Both: Answer questions
   - Both: See AI-powered match results
   - Both: View final vibe analysis

## Environment Variables Needed

### Backend
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI-powered answer matching (optional, has fallback)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3001)

### Frontend
- Update `SOCKET_URL` in `services/socket.ts` to match your backend URL

## Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Player ID now properly tracked and passed through all screens
2. ✅ GameScreen uses playerId instead of playerName for answer submission
3. ✅ Score tracking correctly identifies which player's score to display
4. ✅ AI SDK dependency added to backend package.json
5. ✅ Round counter displays correctly (0-indexed to 1-indexed)

## Next Steps

- Add environment variable configuration UI
- Add error handling for network issues
- Add loading states for AI processing
- Add ability to replay with same partner
- Add match history storage

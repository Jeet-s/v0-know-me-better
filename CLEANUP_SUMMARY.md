# Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

All Next.js and web-specific files have been removed from the project since this is a React Native app using React Navigation.

### Removed Directories:
- **app/** - Next.js/Expo Router files (not needed with React Navigation)
- **components/** - shadcn/ui web components (not compatible with React Native)
- **hooks/** - Web-specific React hooks
- **lib/** - Web utility functions
- **public/** - Static assets folder (React Native uses assets/ instead)
- **styles/** - Web CSS files

### Removed Configuration Files:
- **next.config.mjs** - Next.js configuration
- **postcss.config.mjs** - PostCSS configuration
- **components.json** - shadcn/ui configuration

## Current Project Structure

The project now contains only React Native specific files:

\`\`\`
├── App.tsx                 # React Navigation setup
├── screens/                # React Native screens
│   ├── HomeScreen.tsx
│   ├── JoinScreen.tsx
│   ├── WaitingScreen.tsx
│   ├── GameScreen.tsx
│   └── ResultsScreen.tsx
├── services/               # Services
│   └── socket.ts          # Socket.IO client
├── data/                   # Game data
│   ├── questions.ts
│   └── vibes.ts
├── utils/                  # Utilities
│   └── gameLogic.ts
├── backend/                # Backend server
│   ├── server.ts          # Socket.IO server
│   ├── ai-matcher.ts      # AI-powered answer matching
│   └── package.json
├── app.json               # Expo configuration
└── package.json           # Dependencies
\`\`\`

## Why These Files Were Removed

1. **Next.js files** - This is a React Native app, not a Next.js web app
2. **shadcn/ui components** - These are web components that don't work in React Native
3. **Web hooks and utilities** - Not compatible with React Native
4. **CSS files** - React Native uses StyleSheet API, not CSS
5. **public/ folder** - React Native uses assets/ folder for static files

The cleanup removes approximately 70+ unused files, making the project structure cleaner and easier to navigate.
